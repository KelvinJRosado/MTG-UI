# MTG-UI: Higher or Lower Card Game

This project is a Magic: The Gathering "Higher or Lower" card game built using [Nx](https://nx.dev) for monorepo management. It consists of a Vue 3 frontend (Composition API) and a Node.js API backend.

## Game Description

In this game, players are shown partial information about a Magic: The Gathering card and asked to guess whether the card was printed before or after a randomly selected year. Players earn points for correct guesses and the game ends when they make an incorrect guess.

## Project Structure

- `ui/`: Vue 3 frontend using Composition API
  - Features a responsive UI for the Higher or Lower game
  - Handles game state and user interactions
- `api/`: Node.js API backend (native HTTP server)
  - Provides game session management
  - Interacts with the Scryfall API to fetch random MTG cards
  - Implements game logic and scoring
- `examples/`: Example data for development and testing
- `tmp/`: Build artifacts and temporary files

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API, Vite, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Native HTTP module
- **External APIs**: Scryfall SDK for Magic card data
- **Project Management**: Nx monorepo tools

## Game Features

- Session-based gameplay with persistent scores
- Random card selection from the entire MTG card database
- Year-based guessing mechanic
- Score tracking and game over state management
- Clean, responsive UI

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/card?name={cardName}`: Fetch a specific card by name
- `POST /api/game/start`: Start a new game session
- `POST /api/game/round`: Start a new round in an existing session
- `POST /api/game/guess`: Submit a guess (before/after)
- `POST /api/game/end`: End a game session manually
- `GET /api/game/state`: Get the current state of a game session

## Future Improvements

- User authentication and persistent player profiles
- Leaderboards and high scores
- Additional game modes and card filtering options
- Performance optimizations and improved caching
- Deployment configurations for production environments
